Seat Allocation in Plane

It was a try to use lombok and hibernate libraries

for this exercise:
I would like to build a seat allocation system for a plane
It should show all available seats
If a seat is taken, it should show that that seat is taken.
All entries should be saved.
It should be possible to ask the system to assign you 
a seat automatically in which case it should assign you a seat 
that fits your ticket class
All users will have name and ticket type,
Based on your ticket type, you can book certain seats on the plane.
It should also be possible to choose a seat from available seats, 
if your ticket fits into seat category, you should be assigned seat of your choice, if not, it rejects your choice.
Application must remember all choices.

==Problems==
App doesn't work properly.
User input is not reflected in DB, DB generates empty fields inside the columns&rows(nevertheless, it works);

==What is inside==
switch statement, userInput, console output, connection to DB, classes with lombok.
